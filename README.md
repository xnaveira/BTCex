BTCex
======

Script for monitoring BTC exchange rates in the command line

It checks FYB-SE which is the one I'm interested on right now but I might add support to configure othe sources.

It changes the color of the values with the classical red for down and green for up. It runs forever if no Keyboard Interrupt is sent (aka Ctrl-C)
